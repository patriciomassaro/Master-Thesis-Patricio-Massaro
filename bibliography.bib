ABSTRACT = {An urban heat island (UHI) is an urban area that is significantly warmer than its surrounding rural areas due to antropogenic activities. The urban area of the city of Skopje has been rising rapidly in the past decade. In this study, the effect of UHI is analyzed using Landsat 8 data in the summer period of 2013–2017 as a case study in Skopje, Macedonia. An algorithm was applied to retrieve the land surface temperature (LST) distribution from the Landsat 8 data. In addition, the correlation between land surface temperature and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the normalized difference build-up index (NDBI) were analyzed to explore the impacts of the green areas and the build-up land on the urban heat island. The results indicate that the effect of the urban heat island in Skopje is located in many sub-urban areas. The negative correlation between LST and NDVI indicates that the green area can weaken the effect on the urban heat island, while the positive correlation between LST and NDBI means that the built-up land can strengthen the effect of the urban heat island in the study area.},

Understanding fundamental remotely sensed concepts helps ecosystem modelers make informed decisions regarding the utility and limitations of the broad spectrum of available remote-sensing and derived data. The main focus of this article is to introduce remote-sensing science and its application to ecological modeling. It is not designed to be comprehensive on the subject of remote sensing, but rather to introduce basic concepts and terminology. The intended audience is consumers, not producers of remote-sensing products. The article begins with an overview of fundamental remote-sensing concepts. This is followed by a section on how remote-sensing data can be used to derive a broad range of biophysical data sets that are useful for terrestrial and aquatic ecological modeling. Several of the more common data sets derived from remotely sensed data are described with comments about how the data sets are produced, their strengths, and limitations. The article concludes with a summary of the accuracy and validation.}

ABSTRACT = {Land Surface Temperature (LST) is an important parameter for many scientific disciplines since it affects the interaction between the land and the atmosphere. Many LST retrieval algorithms based on remotely sensed images have been introduced so far, where the Land Surface Emissivity (LSE) is one of the main factors affecting the accuracy of the LST estimation. The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of LST retrieval methods using different LSE models and data of old and current Landsat missions. Mono Window Algorithm (MWA), Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE) method, Single Channel Algorithm (SCA) and Split Window Algorithm (SWA) were assessed as LST retrieval methods processing data of Landsat missions (Landsat 5, 7 and 8) over rural pixels. Considering the LSE models introduced in the literature, different Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)-based LSE models were investigated in this study. Specifically, three LSE models were considered for the LST estimation from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and seven Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and six for Landsat 8. For the accurate evaluation of the estimated LST, in-situ LST data were obtained from the Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD) stations. In total, forty-five daytime Landsat images; fifteen images for each Landsat mission, acquired in the Spring-Summer-Autumn period in the mid-latitude region in the Northern Hemisphere were acquired over five SURFRAD rural sites. After determining the best LSE model for the study case, firstly, the LST retrieval accuracy was evaluated considering the sensor type: when using Landsat 5 TM, 7 ETM+, and 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), and Thermal infra-red Sensor (TIRS) data separately, RTE, MWA, and MWA presented the best results, respectively. Then, the performance was evaluated independently of the sensor types. In this case, all LST methods provided satisfying results, with MWA having a slightly better accuracy with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) equals to 2.39 K and a lower bias error. In addition, the spatio-temporal and seasonal analyses indicated that RTE and SCA presented similar results regardless of the season, while MWA differed from RTE and SCA for all seasons, especially in summer. To efficiently perform this work, an ArcGIS toolbox, including all the methods and models analyzed here, was implemented and provided as a user facility for the LST retrieval from Landsat data.},

abstract = {Land surface temperature (LST) is one of the key parameters in the physics of land surface processes from local through global scales. The importance of LST is being increasingly recognized and there is a strong interest in developing methodologies to measure LST from space. However, retrieving LST is still a challenging task since the LST retrieval problem is ill-posed. This paper reviews the current status of selected remote sensing algorithms for estimating LST from thermal infra-red (TIR) data. A brief theoretical background of the subject is presented along with a survey of the algorithms employed for obtaining LST from space-based TIR measurements. The discussion focuses on TIR data acquired from polar-orbiting satellites because of their widespread use, global applicability and higher spatial resolution compared to geostationary satellites. The theoretical framework and methodologies used to derive the LST from the data are reviewed followed by the methodologies for validating satellite-derived LST. Directions for future research to improve the accuracy of satellite-derived LST are then suggested.}

ABSTRACT = {In this study, we explored the characteristics of thermal anomalies other than biomass burning to establish a zone map of false-positive active fires to support efficient ground validation for firefighters. We used the ASCII file of VIIRS active fire data (VNP14IMGML), which provides attributes of thermal anomalies every month from 2012 to 2020 in Indonesia. The characteristics of thermal anomalies other than biomass burning were explored using fire radiative power (FRP) values, confidence levels of active fire, fire pixel areas, and their allocations to permanent geographical features (i.e., volcano, river, lake, coastal line, road, and industrial/settlement areas). The Tukey test showed that there was a significant difference between the mean FRP values of the other thermal anomalies, type-1 (active volcano), type-2 (other static land sources), and type-3 (detection over water/offshore), at a confidence level of 95%. Most thermal anomalies other than biomass burning were in the nominal confidence level with a fire pixel area of 0.21 km2. High spatial images validated these thermal anomaly types as false positives of biomass burning. A zone map of potential false-positive active fire for biomass burning was established in this study by referring to the allocation of thermal anomalies from permanent geographical features. Implementing the zone map removed approximately 13% of the VIIRS active fires as the false positive of biomass burning. Insights gleaned through this study will support efficient ground validation of actual forest/land fires.},
